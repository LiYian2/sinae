## Overall Agent Result

| Scope | Topics | Papers | Edges | Communities | Landmark Hit | Topic Precision | Ordering | Community Coverage | Stage Coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| All benchmark topics | 12 | 21.5 | 121.8 | 3.9 | 61.9% | 91.7% | 68.4% | 91.4% | 95.8% |
| Excluding protein low-corpus case | 11 | 22.7 | 131.7 | 4.0 | 67.6% | 93.3% | 74.6% | 90.6% | 97.7% |

Interpretation: the full agent is strongest on topic precision, stage coverage, and community coverage. The main weakness is landmark recall/order on topics where scholarly metadata is incomplete or where the topic contains important non-arXiv/non-OpenAlex artifacts, especially mechanistic interpretability and the saved protein benchmark corpus.

## Skill 1: Literature Retrieval Implementation

Skill 1 turns a research topic and user profile into a graph-ready paper corpus. It uses LLM-assisted query normalization when available, deterministic fallback queries otherwise, arXiv/OpenAlex retrieval, duplicate removal by normalized title, topic filtering, verified landmark recovery, Semantic Scholar citation/reference enrichment, and corpus quality metrics. The latest implementation also uses HTTPS arXiv API calls, global arXiv throttling with retry/backoff, and `S2_API_KEY` when available.

| Variant | Topics | Papers | Raw Records | Duplicates Removed | Abstract Coverage | Citation Metadata | Reference Coverage | Landmark Hit | Topic Precision | Graph Edges | Graph Edge Yield |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A_arxiv_only | 12 | 26.2 | 28.6 | 2.4 | 100.0% | 51.8% | 52.8% | 72.8% | 75.5% | 172.5 | 6.18 |
| B_openalex_only | 12 | 32.2 | 40.0 | 7.8 | 88.4% | 100.0% | 93.5% | 70.0% | 31.1% | 98.0 | 3.16 |
| C_arxiv_openalex | 12 | 45.0 | 68.6 | 12.6 | 96.7% | 92.8% | 89.1% | 90.3% | 60.6% | 224.8 | 5.00 |
| D_plus_topic_filtering | 12 | 40.0 | 68.6 | 12.6 | 98.6% | 92.8% | 88.8% | 90.3% | 66.6% | 241.4 | 5.93 |
| E_plus_verified_landmarks | 12 | 40.1 | 68.6 | 12.6 | 98.6% | 93.7% | 89.8% | 91.7% | 66.7% | 241.8 | 5.92 |

Skill 1 conclusion: combining arXiv and OpenAlex improves landmark recall over either source alone. Topic filtering reduces corpus size from 45.0 to about 40.0 papers while raising topic precision from 60.6% to 66.6% and graph edge yield from 5.00 to 5.93. Verified landmarks give a small additional recall gain, from 90.3% to 91.7%, without degrading precision.

Important nuance: E is not supposed to dominate every metric. It is optimized for milestone recall and downstream graph readiness, while arXiv-only can show higher topic precision because arXiv search returns narrower technical papers and OpenAlex has broader, noisier coverage.

## Skill 2: Research Graph Analysis Implementation

Skill 2 builds citation and semantic-similarity graph structure. Citation edges preserve scholarly dependency, while TF-IDF similarity edges recover connectivity when citation/reference metadata is sparse. Analysis computes PageRank on a directed citation graph, undirected/hybrid community structure, betweenness with inverse-distance semantics for weighted similarity edges, Louvain/greedy communities, and foundation/bridge/frontier role scores. LLM is used only for community labels, not for centrality computation.

| Mode | Topics | Edges | Components | Largest Component | Modularity | Communities | Path Community Coverage | Bridge Plausibility | Foundation Landmark Hit | Edge Yield |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| citation | 12 | 7.2 | 17.2 | 20.2% | 0.0996 | 10.8 | 70.1% | 17.5% | 75.0% | 0.25 |
| similarity | 12 | 118.5 | 1.8 | 95.7% | 0.1712 | 4.0 | 89.2% | 77.6% | 75.0% | 4.81 |
| hybrid | 12 | 125.8 | 1.4 | 96.9% | 0.1792 | 3.9 | 91.4% | 81.9% | 66.7% | 5.06 |

Graph ablation conclusion: citation-only is theoretically clean but too sparse in this dataset, averaging only 7.2 edges and 20.2% largest component ratio. Similarity-only gives strong connectivity, but lacks citation direction. Hybrid is the production choice because it keeps citation evidence while improving largest component ratio to 96.9%, path community coverage to 91.4%, and bridge plausibility to 81.9%.

Secondary average excluding the low-corpus protein run shows the same trend: hybrid reaches 97.7% largest component ratio and 90.6% path community coverage.

## Skill 3: Reading Path and Report Implementation

Skill 3 converts graph scores and communities into staged reading paths. It assigns papers to prerequisite/foundation/core/development/bridge/frontier stages, uses role evidence packets for explanations, calls the LLM explanation writer when enabled, and generates Markdown reports with abstracts, URLs, role scores, why-read text, graph figures, score distributions, and follow-up suggestions. The GUI additionally lets users mark papers as read and fold completed items.

| Variant | Topics | Path Papers | Landmark Hit | Ordering | Community Coverage | Stage Coverage | Topic Precision | Explanation Coverage |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| random_order | 11 | 10.5 | 63.0% | 55.4% | 95.1% | 0.0% | 94.9% | 100.0% |
| citation_count_order | 11 | 10.5 | 76.1% | 76.3% | 96.4% | 0.0% | 93.4% | 100.0% |
| pagerank_order | 11 | 10.5 | 68.5% | 59.9% | 91.9% | 0.0% | 93.7% | 100.0% |
| researchtrail_staged | 11 | 10.5 | 67.6% | 72.0% | 90.6% | 97.7% | 95.3% | 100.0% |

Skill 3 conclusion: citation-count and PageRank are strong baselines for landmark recall on some topics, but they do not create a pedagogical path. ResearchTrail staged paths are the only variant with high stage coverage, 97.7%, while keeping topic precision at 95.3% and ordering quality at 72.0%. This supports the claim that Skill 3 adds value by turning graph rankings into a usable learning sequence rather than just sorting papers.

## End-to-End Architecture

The agent is a markdown-described, code-backed, LLM-assisted workflow:

1. Agent planner parses the user request, topic, level, and desired output. LLM mode uses SiliconFlow/OpenAI-compatible chat completions with `SILICON_FLOW_API`; fallback mode uses deterministic rules.
2. Literature Retrieval Skill constructs a corpus through query expansion, retrieval, filtering, deduplication, landmark verification, and metadata enrichment.
3. Graph Skill builds citation/similarity/hybrid graphs and computes deterministic SNA metrics and paper role scores.
4. Community labeler optionally uses LLM to name graph communities from evidence packets.
5. Reading Path Skill creates staged reading paths and evidence-grounded explanations.
6. Report/visualization layer writes Markdown reports, graph visualizations, score distributions, state files, and GUI-ready outputs.

## Report Claims Supported by Evaluation

- Skill 1 is robust as a corpus builder because multi-source retrieval plus topic filtering improves precision and graph edge yield without sacrificing landmark recall.
- Skill 2 is necessary because citation-only metadata is too sparse for many modern topics; the hybrid graph materially improves connectivity and bridge-paper analysis.
- Skill 3 is necessary because ranking baselines do not provide stage structure; staged reading paths preserve high topicality while adding pedagogical organization.
- The full system is not just a summarizer: it retrieves papers, builds a research network, assigns structural paper roles, and generates a personalized reading path with visual evidence.

## Limitations to State Explicitly

- The benchmark landmark lists are curated for evaluation. In the system, verified landmarks are recovered through API metadata and should be described as a recall aid, not as manual insertion of final results.
- OpenAlex has broad coverage but lower topic precision on some engineering-heavy topics; arXiv is narrower and often cleaner but weaker on citation/reference metadata.
- Citation metadata remains incomplete for some domains, which is why the hybrid graph is more reliable than citation-only graph construction.
- The saved 12-topic overall benchmark has a weak protein structure run with only 8 papers; the Skill 1 rerun shows this topic can retrieve a much healthier corpus, so report the original end-to-end protein result as low-confidence or rerun the full agent if time permits.
- Role scores are still heuristic combinations of network metrics, recency, citation count, and community position. LLM helps explain evidence but does not replace the deterministic scores.

## Suggested Manual Evaluation Dimensions

Use the files in `outputs/reading_path_ablation/full_11_topics/paths_for_human_eval/` and score each path 1-5 on: topical relevance, landmark coverage, reading-order coherence, community/subfield coverage, explanation usefulness, beginner friendliness, and whether bridge papers are plausible.
